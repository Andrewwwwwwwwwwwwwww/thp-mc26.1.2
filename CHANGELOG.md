# The Hungering Portal Changelog

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-15
### Added
- **An advancement tree for the portal ritual.** A new tab, on a purpur background, showing every offering the portal demands. The root unlocks the moment you join, so the whole checklist is visible from the start rather than appearing only once you stumble onto your first offering.
- One advancement per offering, all ten of them: the Trident, Netherite Block, Sniffer Egg, Enchanted Golden Apple, Totem of Undying, Beacon, Mace, 16 Wither Roses, Conduit and Zombie Head. Each carries its ritual flavour text plus a hint about where to actually find the thing.
- The four that gate on a boss or a rare structure — Netherite Block, Beacon, Mace and the 16 Wither Roses — are **challenge** advancements; the rest are goals.
- **VanillaSkills players earn Skill Shards for these.** VanillaSkills 2.0 counts the `thp` namespace when awarding shards per advancement, so finishing the tab is worth 110 Skill Shards at its default rates. THP remains completely standalone — without VanillaSkills installed these are simply advancements.
- Traditional Chinese (zh_tw) translations for all 22 new strings, keeping both languages complete at 68 keys.


## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-21
### Added
- **Full localization support.** Every player-facing string — the portal ritual titles and chat, the offering list, command feedback, and the Mod Menu config screen — is now translatable. English is the built-in default; drop a `<locale>.json` in the jar or in `<world>/thp/lang/` to translate. See `TRANSLATING.md`.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- **A custom, multi-phase Ender Dragon fight.** After the portal ritual is complete and players
  first enter the End, an overhauled dragon boss plays out in a custom arena: an aerial phase
  (fireballs, meteors, TNT lines, lightning endermen), a shulker-summoning "Hyper Jean" phase
  (lightning rings, homing missiles, a splitting dragon, teleports), a wave-based add fight, and
  a healing-crystal finale. The vanilla dragon fight is fully suppressed; the surrounding vanilla
  End island is cleared and replaced by the custom arena, generated on first entry while players
  are held safely above it.
- When the dragon dies, the **exit portal lights inside the arena's central fountain** (a sunken
  portal pool around the dragon-egg pillar) and **full vanilla End gateways** are generated, so
  players can return home and explore the outer End as usual.
- **The dragon can be revived vanilla-style**: place 4 End Crystals on the obsidian pads around
  the exit portal to respawn it and run the whole fight again (the portal goes dark during the
  fight and relights on victory; the egg and gateways only appear on the first kill).

### Changed
- **Offerings updated**: the Recovery Compass is replaced by **16 Wither Roses** (throw in any
  stacks — partial progress counts and is returned if the portal times out), and the Pigstep
  Music Disc is replaced by a **Conduit**.
- `/thp portalreq` now prints the requirements **in chat only**; the on-screen title sequence
  plays only when a player jumps into a not-yet-opened portal.

### Notes
- The fight is **derived from [RogueCraft](https://modrinth.com/datapack/rogue-craft) by MonoCode**,
  used under **CC-BY-SA-4.0** and adapted to run standalone (roguelite difficulty scaling, skillpoints,
  and hub return removed). See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. That bundled data carries CC-BY-SA-4.0; the
  mod's own code/assets remain under the project license.
- Wave mobs use base vanilla stats (RogueCraft's run-based difficulty scaling does not apply here).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-27

### Changed
- **Stable 2.0.0 release.** No gameplay changes from 1.5.0 — this marks the mod stable and aligns it with
  the unified release across the mod suite.
- **Jar filenames now include the Minecraft version** (e.g. `thp-2.0.0+mc26.2.jar`) so the 26.2 and
  26.1.2 downloads are unambiguous.
- A parallel **MC 26.1.2** build is now published (`thp-2.0.0+mc26.1.2.jar`) for players still on the
  older version.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- **Updated to Minecraft 26.2.** Bumped to Fabric Loader 0.19.3 and Fabric API 0.152.1+26.2
  (Fabric Loom stays at 1.16.2 — 1.17.x requires Gradle 9.5, above the workspace's 9.4.0 wrapper).
  Dependency bounds in `fabric.mod.json` raised to match (`minecraft ~26.2`, `fabricloader >=0.19.3`,
  `fabric-api >=0.152.1`). No gameplay changes.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-09

### Changed
- **Rebranded EndBeast → "The Hungering Portal".** The mod name (and Mod Menu entry), the mod id
  (`endbeast` → `thp`), and the jar filename (`thp-x.x.x.jar`) all use the new name. The command is
  now **`/thp`** (subcommands unchanged: `portalreq`, `setendplayercount`, `reset`).
- **`/endbeast` still works** as a backwards-compatible alias.
- In-game ritual flavor text ("The End Portal hungers…") is intentionally unchanged. Existing world
  state in `<world>/endbeast.json` is preserved (the save filename is kept for continuity).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- `/endbeast reset` (ops only) — re-locks the End Portal so the full ritual is required again.
  Clears the activated state and any in-progress ritual progress, and announces "The End Portal
  hungers once more." (In-progress offerings are not returned.)

---

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- Chat requirement list now appends the actual item name in parentheses after each poetic clue, e.g. `A hand held savior (Totem of Undying)`, making it immediately clear what to collect.

---

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- Mod Menu config screen and README referenced the command as `/EndBeast`; corrected to `/endbeast` to match the case-sensitive Brigadier registration.

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Mod Menu integration — players can configure the required participant count via the in-game mod list without using commands. Multiplayer clients see a read-only screen with the relevant commands instead.
- Icon updated to 400×400 RGBA PNG for CurseForge logo compatibility.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- Five new required offerings: Beacon, Mace, Recovery Compass, Pigstep Music Disc, Zombie Head — bringing the total to ten items.
- Player-count requirement line added to the chat backup that fires after the on-screen slideshow, so witnesses needed is always visible in the chat history.
- Title/subtitle display now adapts to GUI scale — large titles use a subtitle line instead of cramming text into the title, preventing overflow at GUI scale 3+.

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- Command `/EndBeast` renamed to `/endbeast` — Brigadier is case-sensitive; the old name was awkward and non-standard.
- Mixin `compatibilityLevel` corrected from `JAVA_21` to `JAVA_25` to match the project's compile target.
- Memory leak: `pendingChats`, `pendingTitles`, and `lastMessageTick` are now cleared when the server reloads, preventing stale UI state from carrying over in development environments.

### Changed
- Fabric Loom pinned to `1.16.2` (stable) — was previously on `1.16-SNAPSHOT`.
- Fabric API dependency tightened to `>=0.148.2` instead of the wildcard `*`.

### Added
- MIT `LICENSE` file added to the repository and packaged in the JAR.
- Updated mod icon (full end portal frame structure with stars).

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- `/endbeast portalreq` command — shows the portal requirements on screen and in chat without needing to interact with the portal.
- Title/subtitle slideshow for requirements display — each item scrolls through sequentially on-screen, with a chat backup after the sequence ends.
- Repackaged to `io.github.andrewwwwwwwwwwwwwww.endbeast` namespace.
- SLF4J logger replaces raw stderr output.
- `fabric.mod.json` contact metadata (homepage, sources, issues).
- README.md with full feature and install documentation.

### Fixed
- Mixin descriptor corrected to include the missing `boolean` parameter in `entityInside` — the mixin previously failed to inject.
- LP-box title rendering replaced with a proper title slideshow sequence that doesn't interfere with other UI.

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Chat message queued after the title/subtitle sequence fades so players have a text reference after the on-screen display is gone.

### Changed
- Portal requirements now displayed on-screen via title/subtitle packets instead of only in chat.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Initial public release (renamed from `enterend`).
- End Portal ritual gate: 12 eyes of ender light the portal, but players are repelled until five specific offerings are thrown in and a minimum number of witnesses are present.
- Required offerings: Trident, Netherite Block, Sniffer Egg, Enchanted Golden Apple, Totem of Undying.
- 60-second offering timeout — if players take too long between offerings the portal returns all items.
- Configurable minimum participant count via `/EndBeast setendplayercount <n>`.
- Persistent world state saved to `<world>/endbeast.json`.
- Activation is world-wide and permanent once triggered.
